# Vending-Machine-Controller

The .vhd file contains the VHDL code for a vending machine controller that sells candy priced at twenty-five cents.

It reacts to inputs such as adding five cents (nickel_in), ten cents (dime_in), and twenty-five cents (quarter_in), indicating when coins are deposited.

Upon reaching twenty-five cents or more, it dispenses a candy_out and potentially returns change, such as nickel_out and dime_out.
